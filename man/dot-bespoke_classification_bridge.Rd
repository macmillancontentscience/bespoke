.bespoke_classification_bridge(processed, fn, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{processed}{Processed inputs molded by hardhat.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed on to \code{fn}.}
}
\value{
A \code{bespoke_classification} model object.

\description{
This bridge is the same for each path into bespoke_classification. It takes
the processed predictors (which are now a tibble) and outcome (which is now a
factor) and, in this case, makes sure they make sense with the supplied
function.
