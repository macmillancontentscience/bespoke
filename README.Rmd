Sometimes it makes sense to define a simple baseline model programmatically, using simple rules defined by subject matter experts.
However, it can be difficult to compare such models to "real" models developed in the [{tidymodels}](https://www.tidymodels.org/) framework.
{bespoke} allows you to wrap such a hand-crafted "model" into a format that fits within the {tidymodels} framework.

## Installation

You can install the development version of bespoke from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("macmillancontentscience/bespoke")
```
